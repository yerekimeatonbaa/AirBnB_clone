Command Line Interpreters

A command line interpreter allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines

How to start a Command line interpreter:

To start a command line interpreter, you typically open a terminal or command prompt on your operating system, here is an example on a linux machine

. Open the terminal using keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl + Alt + T or find it in your application launcher.

How to Use a Command Line Interpreter: Once you have the terminal or command prompt open, you can start entering commands. Here are some basic examples,

To Navigating Directories: (a) cd Documents (the 'cd' command takes you from the curret directory to the specified directory) (b) ls (the 'ls' command is used to list files in the current directory)

To Run Program: You can execute programs by typing their names, for example python my_script.py

Command Options and Arguments: (a) ls -l (Many commands support options and arguments. Options are often preceded by a dash (e.g., -l), and arguments are additional information provided to the command)

(b) ls > file_list.txt (Used to redirect Input and Output of command)

(c) ls | grep "txt" (Use to pipe the output of one command into another)

Example Usage: To execute a file in the command interpreter, you use do the following

cd (input name of the Directory) chmod +x (input the file name you want to execute) ./(input the file name ypu want to execute)
